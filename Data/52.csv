game,Alum,338420,0,False,,[372100],"Guide Alum on his spiritual journey through the dangerous, icy, &quot;Land of Tide&quot;. Help him discover the truth about his city, Kosmos, and the mysterious epidemic known as &quot;The Vague&quot;. As the tale unfolds, it will keep you enthralled all the way up to its epic conclusion. <br />
<br />
Alum is written as a sort of Christian Allegory along the lines of Pilgrims Progress or The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe.<br />

Alum is an original point-and-click adventure game. It has the nostalgic feel of classics (90's Lucasarts, Sierra games) mixed with modern game-play elements and pacing that caters more towards this generation. The world, story, and characters lean towards a RPG-esque style, while the game-play mechanics and puzzles stay true to the classic point-and-click genre. <br />
<br />
- Features -<br />
* Full length game (roughly 7-10 hours of gameplay)<br />
* Over 70 hand-drawn backgrounds - Including a map screen to travel across the &quot;Land of Tide&quot; <br />
* All original soundtrack (live recorded instruments mixed with electronic elements) <br />
* Intuitive puzzles that are logical, balanced, and rewarding (no pixel hunting) <br />
* Full voice acting <br />
* Gratifying frame by frame animations <br />

The 15-year mission was going according to plan, until the ship was reportedly destroyed during a geological event. Nearly 50 years later, you discover the ship - adrift in space - and dock your salvage vessel to board and retrieve the valuable data core. The ship has no breathable atmosphere. The crew is nowhere to be found. However, there are traces of an unidentified toxin inside…<br><br>How did the ship get here? What happened to the crew? As you venture in further to find out, the ship suddenly powers up. An alarm is triggered, the docking port locks down and you are trapped inside. It’s then that you receive a harrowing transmission from somewhere deep inside the ship. A warning… that you are not alone.<br><br><img src=""https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/611820/extras/largebanner_gameplay.png?t=1598875872"" /><br>Xenosis: Alien Infection is a retro-inspired, top down sci-fi adventure / survival game, with a focus on a story-driven single-player experience.

game,SUMMER VACATION,658360,0,False,,,"Summer! Beach! VR!!!<br />
<br />
Summer's here, and it's hot, hot, HOT!<br />
Phew, it's SO hot, a vacation at a tropical beach resort would really hit the spot!<br />
...That's not a bad idea! So, how about embarking on a VR trip to the sea and the sand.<br />
Don't worry, there's a beautiful beach babe there to keep you company!<br />
<br />
■Try a Beach-Load of Activities!<br />
Whack watermelons, fling frisbees, vibe with volleyball, fish for fishies, double-up on drinks...this VR beach resort is filled with stuff to do! Don't worry, your charming friend will be there every step of the way to make the experience all the sweeter!<br />
<br />
■♡Exciting♡Oil♡Massages♡<br />
Whoa whoa whoa, where do you think you're going? Sunburn carries serious health risks, so make sure to rub in that suntan lotion before hitting the beach. It's hard to do a good job by yourself though, so make sure to team up with your girl friend, take turns, and massage it into every last spot! Depending on what type you pick, you both might end up golden brown, texture like sun. Oh, and don't forget to put the lotion in the basket when you're done!<br />
<br />
■Post-Game Content<br />
The story's great and all, but what happens after the tale is told? Why, our free gravure photo shoot mode! Play the fashion photographer and make sure to capture that perfect pose at the perfect angle. You'll even be able to change your lovely model's clothes, hair, and outfit. Create the perfect girl for you, then play the game again to experience your ultimate dream vacation!<br />
<br />
■Story Summary<br />
Ahh, another boring ol' summer vacation, same as last year, which was the same as the year before...<br />
...Or so it seemed, until you were hired on as our heroic heroine's private tutor for the summer and flown off for a wild working vacation on a tropical island paradise. But, uh-oh! Your pupil is no honor student, and she's always skipping class to skip-a-dee-doo-dah across the beach. Oh, woe! Oh, the humanity! Tutoring is your passion, and yet you are stymied at every turn! But soon, your resolve begins to break, and reluctantly—so reluctantly—you begin to join your capricious pupil for fun times at the beach.","Summer! Beach! VR!!!<br />

This game, &quot;Vale of Myth,&quot; is the first arc. Due to high development costs, the second arc will only be developed if the first is successful. </strong><br><br>&quot;It all started with a drunken bet - kill the Cuelebre and make a sack of gold. After being swindled out of the prize money, things get heated fast. Now Garbhan, a Scottish Highlander, and Francis, a bard notorious for his inability to sing, reluctantly depart on a journey together.&quot;<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Overview</h2><br>Res Judicata, or RJ for short, is a 2D comical low-fantasy JRPG, set in an alternate-history Earth in 1315 AD, shortly after the Pope dissolves the Templar Order. Blending the best aspects of western and eastern RPGs and boasting an average playtime of 20 - 30 hours; RJ highlights mythologies, locations, and cultures around the globe! Those tired of playing pest-control will be thrilled to hear there are no rats, bats, or orcs here; Vale of Myth's bestiary is a collection of hand-picked mythological creatures from many cultures. New to JRPGs? No problem! RJ encourages new players with a number of accessibility, difficulty, help, and save options. Take on the role of Garbhan, Scottish Highlander, as he battles (and drinks) his way across the old world. During his journey, Garbhan will join forces with three dysfunctional companions, including Francis, a bard notorious for his utter lack of singing talent, and Daron, a chivalrous ex-knight notorious for his skirt-chasing.

Each of them has carefully chosen, symbolic names. Many carry physical and mental scars, deep motivations for their actions and conflicting emotions. They laugh, tease one another, have candid moments, lose their tempers, and cry. These individuals try to work together in teams and open up to their comrades, while trying to protect their secrets.

Track how thoroughly a location has been explored on the World Map, which tracks all chests and secrets found on a per-location basis.

Tired of NPCs who never acknowledge when you took care of their problems? In Res Judicata, most (if not all) NPCs react to any concerns of theirs you address.

game,Asteroid Hunter,685700,0,False,,,"Asteroid hunter is a top down shoot em up game in which you are a pilot in control of a small yet resilient space craft. Your objective is a simple one, try and collect as much ore as possible and blow up anything that happens to make the mistake of getting in your way.

game,Hiro's Forest Rumble,780430,0,False,,,"The Hiro's are back. Now the forest is awake and all the species are at war.<br />
<br />
Upgrade all characters, use invincibility and head start perks, and run as fast and as far away as you can, beyond their garden and even their known forest. Travel to the swamp, cave, mountains, and snowy plains, gather lost friends and fight as a team against foxes, wolves, and bears. Watch out for the poisonous spiders and sharp needles of the hedgehogs.<br />
<br />
Use Benny to throw carrots, Lola to speed up with her magic hat, and the elder that taught them the ancient way of Martial Arts. Collect cabbages to unlock Hiro's mighty blast of stinky cabbage and put on the run all of the nearby enemies.<br />
<br />
You can also play instead as the foxes, wolves or bears, using their amazing abilities - a pack of fox cubs that steal gold coins from the enemies, hungry wolves that trample over everything or the tremendous roar of the angry, voracious bear.<br />
<br />
Features:<br />
- 4 playable factions, each with 3 different characters<br />
- Ramping difficulty: the run gets harder the further you get; how long can you survive?<br />
- 6 different areas: escape the spider-infested swamp and then freeze in fear of the mighty polar bear<br />
- Epic and unique boss encounters: survive the fight for a set interval of time to advance, or win the fight and also get rewarded with huge amounts of gold!<br />
- Personal upgrade lines for each faction; the bears might be slower, but their resistance is superior<br />
- Daily missions to complete and 50+ challenging achievements<br />

It would be set in an immersive world with beautiful art, and a fully realized set of characters with convincing backstories and motivations. It would have responsive, intuitive controls, a class-leading UI system, and a full orchestral soundtrack. Then, about 10 minutes into development, someone reminded us that we are much too lazy to make that game so we made this one instead: <br><br>Grab cash, drop bombs, and run from Haters in this thinly veiled attempt to make quick money with a reskin of some Snake game we found on the Internet.

It would be set in an immersive world with beautiful art, and a fully realized set of characters with convincing backstories and motivations. It would have responsive, intuitive controls, a class-leading UI system, and a full orchestral soundtrack. Then, about 10 minutes into development, someone reminded us that we are much too lazy to make that game so we made this one instead: <br><br>Grab cash, drop bombs, and run from Haters in this thinly veiled attempt to make quick money with a reskin of some Snake game we found on the Internet.

game,4th Generation Warfare,1204230,0,False,,[1584710],"<strong>Fourth-Generation Warfare simulates warfare in the 21st century, which, in addition to the direct opposition of military forces, now includes espionage, international politics, cyberwarfare, media manipulation, and trade wars.<br>As the leader of a nation, dispatch and control your agents all around the world to destabilize your enemies and establish your supremacy.<br>All methods are fair game: hacking, sabotage, political interference, military strikes, corruption, assassinations, energy domination, data theft…  <br>4GW combines a strategy game with the functions of a role-playing game in solo or multi-player.</strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Gameplay</h2><br>As the head of a nation in the modern world, the player controls a group of characters. Each character performs actions specific to their position or function (examples: contract negotiations for a diplomat, sabotage for a spy, cyberattacks for a hacker, inquiries for an investigator…). You can also opt to move military units, or for actions called &quot;leverage&quot; (examples: invitation to a restaurant, offering a bribe, threatening with blackmail…) performed by non-playable characters, allowing you to later compel them to commit acts of betrayal. More than 100 different actions are possible. The psychological profile, experience and abilities of the characters, possession of weapons and particular objects factor into their odds of success.<br>Meanwhile, adversaries (other nations controlled by human players or by AI) are also performing actions.<br><br>The game is played turn-by-turn or in real time. In turn by turn mode, each player has a limited number of actions available per turn that he or she can distribute among their characters. In real time mode, players are only limited by the run-time of the actions their characters are performing.<br><br>All throughout the game, a news website and characters' smartphones inform the player of action results and other game events.<br>Each country's score is based on 5 factors (world diplomacy, military conquest, economic outcomes, popularity, character's XP level) which creates a ranking.<br>If a head of state loses power or dies, the controlling player is eliminated.<br>The last country standing or the first-ranked country after the last turn wins the game. Optional secret objectives can also tip the balance towards victory.<br><br>The game is played on a current map of the world, viewable in 2D and in 3D. The map shows all national borders, cities and important strategic locations (military bases, power plants, factories...). The player can access city maps with its various buildings (palace of the Head of State, headquarters of the army, secret services or the police, restaurants, embassies, characters' residences, secret hideouts…) and interact with the characters in those locations. Certain buildings have a computer server for their operations and contain databases of sensitive information; they can be targets for cyberattacks aimed at blocking or stealing this data.<br>Maps of the major capitals are consistent with the real-world cities.<br>There are various map display modes: diplomatic, military, electoral, etc; there is also a minimap.<br>The world map changes according to players' building projects, damage from war or sabotage, military strategies and territorial conquests. Moreover, all major events are displayed on the affected areas (demonstrations, attacks, crimes...)<h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Real 21st Century</h2><br>The game is played on a current map of the world, viewable in 2D and in 3D. The map shows all national borders, cities and important strategic locations (military bases, power plants, factories...). The player can access city maps with its various buildings (palace of the Head of State, headquarters of the army, secret services or the police, restaurants, embassies, characters' residences, secret hideouts…) and interact with the characters in those locations. Certain buildings have a computer server for their operations and contain databases of sensitive information; they can be targets for cyberattacks aimed at blocking or stealing this data.<br>Maps of the major capitals are consistent with the real-world cities.<br>There are various map display modes: diplomatic, military, electoral, etc; there is also a minimap.<br>The world map changes according to players' building projects, damage from war or sabotage, military strategies and territorial conquests. Moreover, all major events are displayed on the affected areas (demonstrations, attacks, crimes...)<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Multiple Characters with a Wide Range of Skills and Psychologies</h2><br><br>There are more than 30 types of characters. There are characters controlled by the player (spies, hackers, police inspectors, ministers, head of armies, diplomats...) and other characters that are only influenced (spouses, journalists, gang leaders, informants, religious dignitaries, artists, psychoanalysts, political opponents...). <br>Each character has a particular psychological profile, helping or hindering the success of their actions. Around fifteen different profiles are represented: sociable, loyal, charismatic, paranoid, introverted… Moreover, variables of stress and fear, calculated according to events (threats, corruption…), can influence their autonomic behavior (surrender, betrayal, coup d’état…).<br>Characters also have a smartphone with which they can manage their contacts, talk to them, negotiate with them, arrange a meeting or store their files (stolen data, photo or video evidence...). These telephones can be GPS-tracked or hacked and their contents pilfered.<br>About thirty special objects can be found or constructed and add bonus or additional skills to characters like: bulletproof vests, fake IDs, compound cameras, explosives, exoskeletons...<br>Actions common to all characters (moving, going to a restaurant, taking/placing/giving/stealing objects, seducing, threatening, marrying/divorcing, interacting, bribing…) are distinguished from actions specific to their profession.<br><br>Examples of specific actions by type of character:<br>    • Head of State: appoint cabinet members, set budget guidelines, denounce the UN, approve nuclear weapons, campaign in elections, begin infrastructure projects…<br>    • Secretary of Diplomacy and Diplomats: implement commercial contracts, sign strategic agreements, vote in the UN, open embassies…<br>    • Head of Secret Services and Spys: infiltrate, sabotage, assassinate, spy, kidnap...<br>    • Cyber-Analysts: hack into a server or smartphone, GPS tracking, plant viruses, reinforce data protection, trace the source of a cyberattack…<br>    • Head of the Army: implement arms deals, construct bases, manage staff, declare martial law…<br>    • Secretary of Interior and Police Investigators: use video surveillance, investigate crimes and offenses, make arrests, interrogate a suspect, conduct a stakeout, monitor a building, break up demonstrations...<br><br>Non-playable characters are also capable of many specific actions: editing articles for journalists, ordering union strikes, influential sermons by religious dignitaries, exhibitions for artists, assassination by a hitman, voting instructions for political leaders...<h2 class=""bb_tag"">A Reactive but Still Influenced Population</h2><br>The level of popular contentment is continuously calculated. It can vary according to the policies of the state (social spending, level of taxation), unemployment rate, purchasing power that changes according to product costs, potential shortages, anxiety levels in the country or the corruption of the leaders. Angry people can start demonstrations or riots, call for a strike and ultimately cause the player to lose the game.<br>The people can also be influenced by the manipulation of information in the media or by natural leaders such as union or party leaders, by religious dignitaries who themselves can be in service of a foreign power.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">A Multitude of Strategies</h2><br>Various configurations are available allowing you to vary the enjoyment of the game:<br><br>    • &quot;Career&quot; Mode: a game mode recommended to new players, the match begins with the only controlled character being the Head of State. You must then choose your closest collaborators and gradually expand your group.<br>    • &quot;Government&quot; Mode: the player can choose at the beginning a dozen characters, allowing to operate within all domains.<br>    • &quot;Sandbox&quot; Mode: a free and exploratory mode, it allows the player to customize their starting group of characters and to play without limits. So, if the head of state dies, the player can still play as their successor<br>    • &quot;Real-time&quot; Option: in this mode, time passes continuously. A character or military unit is active for the time it takes to perform an action before performing another. The player can use the &quot;Pause&quot; and &quot;Fast-Forward&quot; buttons to control the speed of the game at any time.<br>    • Turn-by-Turn Option: in this mode, each turn corresponds to one day during which each character or military unit can perform one available action. At the end of the turn, AI adversaries perform their actions.<br>    • &quot;Multinational&quot; Option: a player can play as several countries and develop different tactics. Many small countries can then face a bigger one on equal footing.<br>    • &quot;Extra Characters&quot; Option: the player can select a certain number of extra characters and devise a strategy before the game even starts.  For example, you can play as journalists or political opponents in a foreign country who can help destabilize the current regime.<br>    • Competitive and Cooperative Multi-Player Mode: players can form teams to compete against each other or the AI. A team can be made up of players who each control a different country or share control of characters from the same nation.<br>    • &quot;Secret Objective&quot; Option: each player (human or AI) can draw an objective which, if attained, will grant bonus points or even immediately win the game. Examples include controlling more than 50% of the hydrocarbon market, tripling the population, changing the regime in an enemy country.<br>    • Game options allow you to fine-tune game dynamics: number of turns, duration of turns, number of actions per turn<br>    • Online High Score: for each type of game session and game level, a player can register their score online making their world ranking known to all.","<strong>Fourth-Generation Warfare simulates warfare in the 21st century, which, in addition to the direct opposition of military forces, now includes espionage, international politics, cyberwarfare, media manipulation, and trade wars.<br>As the leader of a nation, dispatch and control your agents all around the world to destabilize your enemies and establish your supremacy.<br>All methods are fair game: hacking, sabotage, political interference, military strikes, corruption, assassinations, energy domination, data theft…  <br>4GW combines a strategy game with the functions of a role-playing game in solo or multi-player.</strong><h2 class=""bb_tag"">Gameplay</h2><br>As the head of a nation in the modern world, the player controls a group of characters. Each character performs actions specific to their position or function (examples: contract negotiations for a diplomat, sabotage for a spy, cyberattacks for a hacker, inquiries for an investigator…). You can also opt to move military units, or for actions called &quot;leverage&quot; (examples: invitation to a restaurant, offering a bribe, threatening with blackmail…) performed by non-playable characters, allowing you to later compel them to commit acts of betrayal. More than 100 different actions are possible. The psychological profile, experience and abilities of the characters, possession of weapons and particular objects factor into their odds of success.<br>Meanwhile, adversaries (other nations controlled by human players or by AI) are also performing actions.<br><br>The game is played turn-by-turn or in real time. In turn by turn mode, each player has a limited number of actions available per turn that he or she can distribute among their characters. In real time mode, players are only limited by the run-time of the actions their characters are performing.<br><br>All throughout the game, a news website and characters' smartphones inform the player of action results and other game events.<br>Each country's score is based on 5 factors (world diplomacy, military conquest, economic outcomes, popularity, character's XP level) which creates a ranking.<br>If a head of state loses power or dies, the controlling player is eliminated.<br>The last country standing or the first-ranked country after the last turn wins the game. Optional secret objectives can also tip the balance towards victory.<br><br>The game is played on a current map of the world, viewable in 2D and in 3D. The map shows all national borders, cities and important strategic locations (military bases, power plants, factories...). The player can access city maps with its various buildings (palace of the Head of State, headquarters of the army, secret services or the police, restaurants, embassies, characters' residences, secret hideouts…) and interact with the characters in those locations. Certain buildings have a computer server for their operations and contain databases of sensitive information; they can be targets for cyberattacks aimed at blocking or stealing this data.<br>Maps of the major capitals are consistent with the real-world cities.<br>There are various map display modes: diplomatic, military, electoral, etc; there is also a minimap.<br>The world map changes according to players' building projects, damage from war or sabotage, military strategies and territorial conquests. Moreover, all major events are displayed on the affected areas (demonstrations, attacks, crimes...)<h2 class=""bb_tag"">The Real 21st Century</h2><br>The game is played on a current map of the world, viewable in 2D and in 3D. The map shows all national borders, cities and important strategic locations (military bases, power plants, factories...). The player can access city maps with its various buildings (palace of the Head of State, headquarters of the army, secret services or the police, restaurants, embassies, characters' residences, secret hideouts…) and interact with the characters in those locations.

Moreover, all major events are displayed on the affected areas (demonstrations, attacks, crimes...)<h2 class=""bb_tag"">Multiple Characters with a Wide Range of Skills and Psychologies</h2><br><br>There are more than 30 types of characters. There are characters controlled by the player (spies, hackers, police inspectors, ministers, head of armies, diplomats...) and other characters that are only influenced (spouses, journalists, gang leaders, informants, religious dignitaries, artists, psychoanalysts, political opponents...). <br>Each character has a particular psychological profile, helping or hindering the success of their actions. Around fifteen different profiles are represented: sociable, loyal, charismatic, paranoid, introverted… Moreover, variables of stress and fear, calculated according to events (threats, corruption…), can influence their autonomic behavior (surrender, betrayal, coup d’état…).<br>Characters also have a smartphone with which they can manage their contacts, talk to them, negotiate with them, arrange a meeting or store their files (stolen data, photo or video evidence...). These telephones can be GPS-tracked or hacked and their contents pilfered.<br>About thirty special objects can be found or constructed and add bonus or additional skills to characters like: bulletproof vests, fake IDs, compound cameras, explosives, exoskeletons...<br>Actions common to all characters (moving, going to a restaurant, taking/placing/giving/stealing objects, seducing, threatening, marrying/divorcing, interacting, bribing…) are distinguished from actions specific to their profession.<br><br>Examples of specific actions by type of character:<br>    • Head of State: appoint cabinet members, set budget guidelines, denounce the UN, approve nuclear weapons, campaign in elections, begin infrastructure projects…<br>    • Secretary of Diplomacy and Diplomats: implement commercial contracts, sign strategic agreements, vote in the UN, open embassies…<br>    • Head of Secret Services and Spys: infiltrate, sabotage, assassinate, spy, kidnap...<br>    • Cyber-Analysts: hack into a server or smartphone, GPS tracking, plant viruses, reinforce data protection, trace the source of a cyberattack…<br>    • Head of the Army: implement arms deals, construct bases, manage staff, declare martial law…<br>    • Secretary of Interior and Police Investigators: use video surveillance, investigate crimes and offenses, make arrests, interrogate a suspect, conduct a stakeout, monitor a building, break up demonstrations...<br><br>Non-playable characters are also capable of many specific actions: editing articles for journalists, ordering union strikes, influential sermons by religious dignitaries, exhibitions for artists, assassination by a hitman, voting instructions for political leaders...<h2 class=""bb_tag"">A Reactive but Still Influenced Population</h2><br>The level of popular contentment is continuously calculated. It can vary according to the policies of the state (social spending, level of taxation), unemployment rate, purchasing power that changes according to product costs, potential shortages, anxiety levels in the country or the corruption of the leaders. Angry people can start demonstrations or riots, call for a strike and ultimately cause the player to lose the game.<br>The people can also be influenced by the manipulation of information in the media or by natural leaders such as union or party leaders, by religious dignitaries who themselves can be in service of a foreign power.<h2 class=""bb_tag"">A Multitude of Strategies</h2><br>Various configurations are available allowing you to vary the enjoyment of the game:<br><br>    • &quot;Career&quot; Mode: a game mode recommended to new players, the match begins with the only controlled character being the Head of State. You must then choose your closest collaborators and gradually expand your group.<br>    • &quot;Government&quot; Mode: the player can choose at the beginning a dozen characters, allowing to operate within all domains.<br>    • &quot;Sandbox&quot; Mode: a free and exploratory mode, it allows the player to customize their starting group of characters and to play without limits. So, if the head of state dies, the player can still play as their successor<br>    • &quot;Real-time&quot; Option: in this mode, time passes continuously. A character or military unit is active for the time it takes to perform an action before performing another. The player can use the &quot;Pause&quot; and &quot;Fast-Forward&quot; buttons to control the speed of the game at any time.<br>    • Turn-by-Turn Option: in this mode, each turn corresponds to one day during which each character or military unit can perform one available action. At the end of the turn, AI adversaries perform their actions.<br>    • &quot;Multinational&quot; Option: a player can play as several countries and develop different tactics.

Each day the captain picks the crew they trust to play in, and those pirates can either obey the captain if they be trustworthy, or disobey if they’re looking to cause some trouble. <br><br>At the end of each day, the crew vote to throw a pirate overboard.
